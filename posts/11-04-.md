I don&#8217;t tend to use a lot of premium plugins, but when I do, I tend to use them a lot. Gravity Forms, WP Migrate DB Pro & Advanced Custom Fields Pro are all part of my daily workflow. I&#8217;m always looking for ways to cut down on repetitive parts of my workflow, and it gets very boring very quickly when I have to add licence keys for all these plugins across local, staging and production environments.
