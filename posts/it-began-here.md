In 1996 I was studying at UEA for a Masters degree in American Studies, under [Professor Richard Crockatt](https://people.uea.ac.uk/r_crockatt). This involved literary and cultural analysis of works since 1960, and I was asked by Prof. Crockatt to review Douglas Rushkoff's recent book "[Cyberia](https://rushkoff.com/books/cyberia/)", along with William Gibson's classic [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer). _Cyberspace_ was all a bit woo-woo back then, wrapped up in the hippies' acid-dipped ideas of group consciousness, but at the same time very open, and hopeful of the possibilities that the Internet could bring.

I thought the best way to review these books was to get on to the web myself, to explore, make connections and then design my own web pages - to try and show rather than tell. And so I took my own trip of discovery, first around campus to try and find the gatekeepers to getting online. I remember no-one seemed to know how the university created web pages, nor where they were stored. But eventually I headed down the green-screened rabbit hole of the terminal, and the magic command `vi index.htm` which - amazingly, and much later - made my own web pages visible within the [NCSA Mosaic browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)).

Here are my first ever webpages, rescued a few years ago from a 3.5" floppy disk [(a what?)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk), and modernised a little in 2006. These pages were written before the dotcom bubble burst, so you'll have to ease around the hyperbole ;)
