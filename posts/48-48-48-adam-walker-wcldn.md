Takes prep from charities &#8211; both technical and marketing (branding, website targeting).

Teams get a brief at the beginning of the event.

Volunteers show up on Friday, quick brief with the charity, then start building. Typically the homepage is done on Friday. Sites go live on Sunday night.

WP multi-tenancy (not multisite) with core set of plugins. Spins up 48 sites at once.

After a month, they can move to GoDaddy for a year for free.

Expectation is set that it’s a gift, not a client project.
