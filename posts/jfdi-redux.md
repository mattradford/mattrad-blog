Last time I got my writing groove on, I wrote "...blogging is important in establishing reputation".

5 years later and it's more "Meh". If I want to write, I'll write. But I want to _own_ my writing, my thoughts. It matters that it's here, on my space on the web, not on someone else's. I want more of the Geocities feel. I used to just make a website for fun, so I want more of that. How much will be written remains to be seen.
