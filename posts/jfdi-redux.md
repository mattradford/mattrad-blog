Last time I got my writing groove on, I wrote ["...blogging is important in establishing reputation"](/jfdi).

5 years later and it's more "Meh". If I want to write, I'll write. But I want to _own_ my writing, my thoughts. It matters that it's here, on my space on the web, not on someone else's. I want more of that [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) feel. I used to just make a website for fun, so I want more of that. How much will be written remains to be seen.

In the meantime, I'm curating the stuff I've already published. There's a fair bit that's accumulated over the years and I'm gradually going through it all, putting posts back up as I have time. I'm taking this as an opportunity to do something other than [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) - because a website like this doesn't need a database, and will have more longevity without one. I'm learning to use [Eleventy](https://11ty.io), a JavaScript-based static site generator, because JS is eating everything. And I get to use all the modern CSS I like, not that there's much CSS going on here at the moment ;)
