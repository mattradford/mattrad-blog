Good RWD starts with structured content. 

You need to know &#8220;the shape of the content&#8221;. 

Design the content first, then build upon it. 

&#8220;What is the message that needs to be communicated if I was only able to provide the user with unsettled HTML&#8221;.

Sculpt the content using basic CSS, using browser dev tools. 

&#8220;See the reality of the content&#8221;. 

Keep checking on real devices.

&#8220;Like sketching, in the browser&#8221;. 

Then start expanding the browser window. When it no longer works, there&#8217;s your breakpoint.
