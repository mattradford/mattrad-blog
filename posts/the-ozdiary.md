Before Will.I.Am there was rad.i.am. In 1997 and 1998 I blogged my way around Australia, before blogging became a thing. With a knowledge of HTML and occasional access to FTP, I uploaded my writing to (I think) a Geocities account, in order to keep people back in the UK updated on my doings and whereabouts. I've a feeling these pages were printed out and _posted_ to my Gran as well. This is how is was before we had Internet access in our eyeballs 24/7.
