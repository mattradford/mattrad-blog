Jeremy Keith&#8217;s &#8220;1 piece of advice around building responsively&#8221;, from this week&#8217;s interview in [responsivedesign.is][1]:

&nbsp;

> I think that even now, there&#8217;s still a tendency for people to think of the desktop view as the default, and the small-screen view as the exception. That&#8217;s a recipe for frustration.
> 
> Think about your content first (whether it&#8217;s a task or it&#8217;s information) in the absence of any screen.
> 
> Then think about that content on a small, constrained screen.
> 
> Finally, allow yourself to think about that content in the context of a larger screen.

&nbsp;

Yes. Content first, then design. What you need to _say_ is more important than how it _looks_. Design is the least important part of web design. And that design needs to be added in little appropriate increments as the screen size increases and allows.

But people don&#8217;t get it. [Mobile overtook desktop in 2014][2]. A larger screen is now a progressive enhancement. Hell, with things like Siri and Google Now and Amazon&#8217;s Echo, we&#8217;re getting to the point where even a _screen_ is an enhancement.

Yet for now, it&#8217;s mobile-first every time, please.
