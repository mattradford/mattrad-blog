Don&#8217;t panic! (_Matt_ &#8211; well maybe panic a bit. Try it on a staging copy of a website first. Don&#8217;t blindly upgrade on live.)

Dropcaps, backgrounds and separators. Pull quotes more easily placed within text.

Shortcodes won&#8217;t break. _Probably_.

Handing over too much control to users? Colours not in line with the brand or design.

Some accessibility cues, e.g. for colour:

<img src="https://mattrad.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_2825.jpg" class="wp-image-879 size-full" height="3024" width="4032" srcset="https://mattrad.local/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_2825.jpg 4032w, https://mattrad.local/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_2825-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mattrad.local/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_2825-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mattrad.local/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_2825-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /> 

Blocks and views is a more appropriate design language than pages and posts. Be aware of different use cases of blocks.

Final point: prepare your clients.

(_Matt_ &#8211; Gutenberg is exciting, no doubt, but with so many WordPress websites in the wild I am bit skeptical that&#8217;ll all be just fine.)
