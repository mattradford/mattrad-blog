### A Question of Deliverables and Other Stuff

Now responsive by default.

A lack of trust is the client&#8217;s initial feeling when they come in.

#### Old design process:

Discuss > Plan > Design > Build > Done

#### New Approach 1:

Tell them nothing about responsive.

Happy clients/same workflow.  
No planning, extra time & cost.

#### New Approach 2:

Promise Nothing.

Same workflow. No promises about what it would look like.  
Over-delivered.  
Could increase timescale & costs.  
No expectations set for client.

#### New Approach 3:

Straight to the code.

Design > Plan > Discuss & Build > Done

&#8220;Discuss & Build&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.  
No deliverables were agreed at any stage.  
Client didn&#8217;t trust what Kirsty was doing.  
Got the data in early though.

#### Now:

More practical approach.  
Iterative. No set process.

Trust needs to be nurtured  
Surprises are never a good idea.  
Clients will form their own opinions and expectations.

If not deliverables, show ideas.
