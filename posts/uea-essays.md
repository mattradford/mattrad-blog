I think I wrote some fairly decent essays while completing my MA in American Studies at [UEA](https://www.uea.ac.uk), between 1996 and 1997. Most of them were written on (I'm pretty sure) a Sharp QL-W30 word processor which saved its data to a proprietary format, so they couldn't be retrived later on a PC running DOS. The only essays I have saved are the three listed here.

But these three topics are still heated discussions today, and my dissertation on abortion in particular both gained me a Distinction (unexpected!) and sent me on the path to volunteering for pro-choice organisations since then.
