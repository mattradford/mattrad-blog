### A few years ago:

I hated my agency

Mean clients

Baldness ensued

### Something had to change

Agency reset:

**1**

Finding your why? (are we doing this)

Write a mission statement

Look at your past

Ask others

**2**

Discover your (key) strengths

Offer services based on those

Don’t chase the money

What are you excited about?

His agency does themes only &#8211; no plugins

**3**

Client goals, blockers and solutions

Key services that play to your strengths

**4**

Messaging

Branding is a consistent voice and message
