Added a colour scheme & branding.  
Large stylesheet to target dashboard elements with CSS.

Three levels of edupress: Bronze (minimum OFSTED requirements), Silver, Gold. Plugin for each of those levels, and a plugin for each which allows extra CPTs to be displayed as you go up the levels.

Filterable content blocks.

CPTs to create banners on home page, e.g. &#8220;Snow, school closed&#8221;. Also registers a submenu page

System doesn&#8217;t use standard pages at all, apart from 3 single pages. Everything else is CPTs.

Edit screens look more like standard WP. Help dialogue on right hand side &#8211; contextual help.

Both have experience in schools ICT.
