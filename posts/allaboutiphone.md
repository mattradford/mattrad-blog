All About iPhone was my technology blogging site, which ran from January 2008 - soon after the phone was released in the UK - until October 2011, the day after Steve Jobs passed away. I wrote over 300 posts on the iPhone, the iPad and things such as "Will the BBC release iPlayer for the iPhone?" (how futuristic!).

This was also the first website I ran using a new content management system called <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.
