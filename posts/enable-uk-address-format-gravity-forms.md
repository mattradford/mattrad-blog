The below is a collection of functions to alter address formatting in Gravity Forms. The built-in format isn&#8217;t very helpful if you&#8217;re in the UK, so this changes the labels and allows a &#8220;UK/Ireland&#8221; choice to be made in the address field of your form.

Include `$formid` if you just want to target one form.
